"""neural_decoder.py - the ONE place brain->locomotor engineering mapping lives.

Biology vs engineering (do not relabel):
- BIOLOGICAL READOUTS: walk/turn/backward/groom/wing/escape/sleep/arousal values
  come from FlyWire DN population rates via SignalBuilder (DNp09/DNa01/DNa02/
  MDN/DNg11/DNp02-04-11/GF). The bridge never recomputes them.
- ENGINEERING APPROXIMATIONS (this file): how those drives modulate an existing
  FlyGym locomotion controller/CPG. Forward gain, steering gain, escape urgency,
  and sleep gating are chosen for stable walking, not measured from the fly.
